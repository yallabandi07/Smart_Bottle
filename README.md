## Project Overview

Title: An IoT-based system utilizing smart sensors to continuously monitor fluid and electrolyte levels
Context: Effective management of fluid and electrolyte levels in hospitals is crucial for optimal patient care and operational efficiency.Current practices often rely on manual monitoring by nursing staff, making them susceptible to human error and delays.



## Abstract

This project proposes an IoT-based system utilizing smart sensors to continuously monitor fluid and electrolyte levels in real-time.
Data is transmitted and alerts when levels fall below predefined thresholds. This ensures timely interventions and accurate data management, enhancing patient safety and reducing the burden of manual checks on medical staff. The system aims to improve hospital efficiency and mitigate risks associated with manual monitoring, ultimately enhancing the quality of patient care.



## Basic Principle

1.Water Level Monitoring Using Water Level Sensor: 
2. Response to Fluid Level:
    i.Low Fluid Level
    ii.Medium Fluid Level
    iii.High Fluid Level
