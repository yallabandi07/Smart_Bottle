## 📝 Project Overview

### 📌 Title:
**Smart Bottle: An IoT-based System for Continuous Monitoring of Fluid and Electrolyte Levels**

### 🏥 Context:
Efficient management of fluid and electrolyte levels in hospitals is critical for ensuring optimal patient care and operational effectiveness. Current practices often rely on manual monitoring by nursing staff, which can lead to delays and human error.

### 📖 Abstract:
This project introduces an **IoT-based system** that leverages smart sensors to continuously monitor fluid and electrolyte levels in real-time. The system transmits data and sends alerts when levels drop below predefined thresholds, enabling timely interventions and accurate data management. By automating monitoring, the system reduces the burden on healthcare staff, mitigates risks associated with manual checks, and ultimately enhances the quality of patient care.

## ⚙️ Basic Principle

1. **Water Level Monitoring Using Sensors**:
   - The system uses water level sensors to continuously track fluid levels.

2. **Response to Fluid Levels**:
   - **Low Fluid Level**:
     - Alerts with **red LED** illumination and **buzzer activation** to prompt immediate intervention.
   - **Medium Fluid Level**:
     - Displays a **yellow LED** as a cautionary signal; the buzzer remains off to avoid unnecessary alarm.
   - **High Fluid Level**:
     - Indicates a safe level using a **white LED**; no buzzer activation.

## 🚀 Final Outcome

The Smart Bottle system effectively monitors fluid and electrolyte levels, providing real-time, clear, and immediate alerts to healthcare personnel. The multi-tiered alert system operates as follows:

### 🛑 Low Fluid Levels:
- When levels drop below predefined thresholds:
  - **Red LED** lights up.
  - **Buzzer sounds** for both visual and audible alerts.

### ⚠️ Medium Fluid Levels:
- For cautionary levels:
  - **Yellow LED** lights up.
  - **Buzzer remains off**.

### ✅ High Fluid Levels:
- When levels are within the safe range:
  - **White LED** lights up.
  - **Buzzer remains off**.

This system ensures healthcare professionals receive precise and timely updates, enhancing **patient safety**, reducing the need for **manual monitoring**, and improving **hospital efficiency**.
